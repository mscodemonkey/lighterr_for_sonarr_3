# Lighterr for Sonarr 3
Light theme for Sonarr v3 - Chrome / Stylus at the moment.

It's early days on this and i'm definitely still refining it so will update it as I make changes and find any old dark stuff I missed :-)

Happy to receive feedback or requests etc.


## Installation
I will do some proper installation instructions and maybe a version that autoupdates etc... but for now you'll need to use the Stylus plugin for Chrome or Firefox.

### When you have installed Stylus
Open up Stylus, import the Json file from this repository.  

### Note
If you're not using port 8989 then change the 8989 at end of the file from 
```
"regexps": [
   ".*:8989.*"
]
```
to whatever port you're using.
